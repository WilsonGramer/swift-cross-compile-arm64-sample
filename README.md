# Cross-compile Swift 5.4 for arm64 (aarch64) with GitHub Actions

This repository contains a sample Swift package that is compiled for arm64 using GitHub Actions. It works by using QEMU to emulate [the arm64 port of Swift](https://github.com/futurejones/swift-arm64).

If you're just looking to install Swift for arm64 on your own machine, [check out this script](https://gist.github.com/WilsonGramer/038ba7e03c2ac27f4c6d52bd1cf5f2e6).
